# Task 1 – Secure User Authentication System

## Task Description

This repository contains Task 1 of the Full Stack Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech. The objective of this task is to develop a Secure User Authentication System using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

The system enables users to:
- Register with a unique email and password
- Securely log in with JWT-based authentication
- Access protected routes only after authentication
- Log out safely, ending their session

It follows secure practices like password hashing, token validation, and clean UI design using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- User Registration with hashed passwords (bcrypt)
- Secure Login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Protected routes accessible only after authentication
- Logout functionality to end the session
- Responsive and modern UI built with React and Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router DOM

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- bcrypt.js (Password Hashing)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT Authentication)

## Installation & Running Locally
