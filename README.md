# Task 1 ‚Äì Secure User Authentication System

## Task Description

This repository contains Task 1 of the Full Stack Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech. The objective of this task is to develop a Secure User Authentication System using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

The system enables users to:
- Register with a unique email and password
- Securely log in with JWT-based authentication
- Access protected routes only after authentication
- Log out safely, ending their session

It follows secure practices like password hashing, token validation, and clean UI design using Tailwind CSS.
